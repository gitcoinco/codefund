> ## ðŸš§ This Plugin Is Deprecated ðŸš§

> This plugin is deprecated in favor of built-in possibilities of [Brunch] (since `2.10`), which can handle CSS automatically. We recommend to remove it from `package.json`. For css-modules use [postcss-brunch].

# css-brunch

Adds CSS support to [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage

Install the plugin via npm with `npm install --save-dev css-brunch`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"css-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app. Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your minor (y) brunch version.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"css-brunch": "git+ssh://git@github.com:brunch/css-brunch.git"`.

### CSS Modules

Starting Brunch `<unreleased>`, you can use CSS Modules with css-brunch. To enable it, change your config to:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    css: {
      modules: true
    }
  }
};
```

You can also pass options directly to [postcss-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules):

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    css: {
      modules: {
        generateScopedName: '[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]'
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Then, author your styles like you normally would:

```css
.title {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

And reference CSS class names by requiring the specific style into your javascript:

```js
var style = require('./title.css');

<h1 className={style.title}>Yo</h1>
```

Note: enabling `cssModules` does so for every stylesheet in your project, so it's all-or-nothing. Even the files you don't require will be transformed into CSS modules (aka will have obfuscated class names, like turn `.title` into `._title_fdphn_1`).
