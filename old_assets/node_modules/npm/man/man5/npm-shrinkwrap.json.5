.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR \- A publishable lockfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fB\fP is a file created by npm help shrinkwrap\. It is identical to
\fB\fP, with one major caveat: Unlike \fB\fP,
\fB\fP may be included when publishing a package\.
.P
The recommended use\-case for \fB\fP is applications deployed
through the publishing process on the registry: for example, daemons and
command\-line tools intended as global installs or \fB\fP\|\. It's
strongly discouraged for library authors to publish this file, since that would
prevent end users from having control over transitive dependency updates\.
.P
Additionally, if both \fB\fP and \fB\fP are present
in a package root, \fB\fP will be ignored in favor of this file\.
.P
For full details and description of the \fB\fP file format, refer
to the manual page for npm help 5 package\-lock\.json\.
