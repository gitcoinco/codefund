.SH EXAMPLE
.P
Make sure you have a package\-lock and an up\-to\-date install:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ cd \./my/npm/project
$ npm install
added 154 packages in 10s
$ ls | grep package\-lock
.fi
.RE
.P
Run \fB\fP in that project

.RS 2
.nf
$ npm ci
added 154 packages in 5s
.fi

.P
Configure Travis to build using \fB\fP instead of \fB\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
# \.travis\.yml
install:
\- npm ci
# keep the npm cache around to speed up installs
cache:
  directories:
  \- "$HOME/\.npm"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This command is similar to \fB\fP, except it's meant to be used in
automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration, and
deployment\. It can be significantly faster than a regular npm install by
skipping certain user\-oriented features\. It is also more strict than a regular
install, which can help catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the
incrementally\-installed local environments of most npm users\.
.P
Concretely, the main differences between an \fB\fP call and an \fB\fP
call are:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
The resulting \fB\fP is not meant for interactive development\.
.IP \(bu 2
The project \fBmust\fR have an existing \fB\fP or \fB\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in \fB\fP, \fB\fP will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\fP can only install entire projects at a time: individual dependencies cannot be added with this command\.
.IP \(bu 2
If a \fB\fP is already present, it will be automatically removed before \fB\fP begins its install\.
.IP \(bu 2
It will never write to \fB\fP or any of the package\-locks: installs are essentially frozen\.
