\fBnpm-run-script\fR \- Run arbitrary package scripts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run\-script <command> [\-\-silent] [\-\- <args>\.\.\.]

alias: npm run
.fi
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This runs an arbitrary command from a package's \fB\fP object\.  If no
\fB\fP is provided, it will list the available scripts\.  \fB\fP is
used by the test, start, restart, and stop commands, but can be called
directly, as well\. When the scripts in the package are printed out, they're
separated into lifecycle (test, start, restart) and directly\-run scripts\.
.P
As of ` \fIhttp://blog\.npmjs\.org/post/98131109725/npm\-2\-0\-0\fR, you can
use custom arguments when executing scripts\. The special option \fB\fP is used by
getopt \fIhttp://goo\.gl/KxMmtG\fR to delimit the end of the options\. npm will pass
all the arguments after the \fB\fP directly to your script:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run test \-\- \-\-grep="pattern"
.fi
.RE
.P
The arguments will only be passed to the script specified after \fB\fP
and not to any pre or post script\.
.P
The \fB\fP script is a special built\-in command that can be used to list
environment variables that will be available to the script at runtime\. If an
"env" command is defined in your package, it will take precedence over the
built\-in\.
.P
In addition to the shell's pre\-existing \fB\fP, \fB\fP adds
\fB\fP to the \fB\fP provided to scripts\. Any binaries provided by
locally\-installed dependencies can be used without the \fB\fP
prefix\. For example, if there is a \fB\fP on \fB\fP in your package,
you should write:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"scripts": {"test": "tap test/\\*\.js"}
.fi
.RE
.P
instead of
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"scripts": {"test": "node_modules/\.bin/tap test/\\*\.js"}  
.fi
.RE
.P
to run your tests\.
.P
The actual shell your script is run within is platform dependent\. By default,
on Unix\-like systems it is the \fB\fP command, on Windows it is the \fB\fP\|\.
The actual shell referred to by \fB\fP also depends on the system\.
As of ` \fIhttps://github\.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5\.1\.0\fR you can
customize the shell with the \fB\fP configuration\.
.P
Scripts are run from the root of the module, regardless of what your current
working directory is when you call \fB\fP\|\. If you want your script to
use different behavior based on what subdirectory you're in, you can use the
\fB\fP environment variable, which holds the full path you were in when
you ran \fB\fP\|\.
.P
\fB\fP sets the \fB\fP environment variable to the \fB\fP executable with
which \fB\fP is executed\. Also, if the \fB\fP is passed,
the directory within which \fB\fP resides is added to the
\fB\fP\|\. If \fB\fP is passed (which has been the
default in \fB\fP v3), this is only performed when that \fB\fP executable is
not found in the \fB\fP\|\.
.P
If you try to run a script without having a \fB\fP directory and it fails,
you will be given a warning to run \fB\fP, just in case you've forgotten\.
.P
You can use the \fB\fP flag to prevent showing \fB\fP output on error\.
