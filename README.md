## What is this?

This is the software behind [codefund.io](https://codefund.io/t/s/76674f2b-a37b-4bf7-8e20-25d3913f0012/). It's an [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) application built on the [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org) web framework, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), and [many](https://github.com/gitcoinco/codefund/blob/master/mix.exs#L42) [other](https://github.com/gitcoinco/codefund/blob/master/assets/package.json) great open source efforts.

## Why is it open source?

We have built our careers on open source. We all owe a great debt to all open source developers who
given so much of their free time and talents to help others. We were also inspired by [The Changelog](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com),
who released their platform open source. Finally, we want to be a trusted partner to the developer
community. To us, ad networks have always felt a bit shady. By being open source, we invite all to
critique our code and ensure we are being honest.

## Development

#### Using Docker

1. Setup a complete docker and docker-compose installation
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy `.env-sample` to `.env`
4. Built the phoenix app into image: `docker-compose build`
5. Create the database: `docker-compose run web mix ecto.create`
6. Run the migrations: `docker-compose run web mix ecto.migrate`
7. Seed the db: `docker-compose run web mix code_fund.seed`
8. Run the services: `docker-compose up -d`
9. Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see CodeFund running.

#### Without Docker (native setup)

Here are some basic steps to get CodeFund running:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gitcoinco/codefund.git
cd web/
# Optionally set the following environment variables (see .env-sample)
# config postgres in config/dev.exs
# start postgres
mix deps.get
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
mix code_fund.seed
cd assets && npm install
cd ../
mix maxmind.setup
mix phx.server
```

#### What To Consider On Your Pull Requests

1. Please run `mix format` prior to submitting a pull request.
2. We're working on adding typespec to the codebase. Please consider adding them to your pull requests so we can move ahead quicker.
3. Please make sure you've added, changed or removed tests accordingly for the code you've modified.
4. Consider running `mix credo list --ignore readability,design,refactor` to make sure your code is consistent and styled well.
5. Have fun!

## Road map

We have a road map of what we are going to implement next.

[CodeFund Q1 Goals](https://github.com/gitcoinco/codefund/issues/1)

If you wish to add features that are not on the road map, you're very welcome to do so. We encourage you to
[create an Issue](https://github.com/gitcoinco/codefund/issues/new)
before coding, so we can all discuss the relevance to the community.

Please keep in mind that the focus is to create a great platform, so we might not implement/accept all the suggested features.
