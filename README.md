Code Sponsor is an sponsorship platform to help fund open source projects and developers. Learn more at [https://codesponsor.io](https://codesponsor.io)

Here are a few blog posts and podcasts that discuss Code Sponsor:

## What is this?

This is the software behind [codesponsor.io](https://codesponsor.io). It's an [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) application built on the [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org) web framework, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), and [many](https://github.com/codesponsor/web/blob/master/mix.exs#L42) [other](https://github.com/codesponsor/web/blob/master/assets/package.json) great open source efforts.

## Why is it open source?

A few reasons:

1. We _love_ open source. Our careers (and livelihoods) wouldn't be possible without open source. Keeping it closed just feels _wrong_.
2. Phoenix is really great, but it's young enough in its lifecycle that there aren't _too many_ in-production, open source sites for people to refer to as examples or inspiration. We want to throw our hat into that ring and hopefully others will follow.
3. We know open sourcing the platform will lead to good things from y'all (such as bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests).

## Development

#### Using Docker

## TODO: This section needs to be fixed

1. Setup a complete docker and docker-compose installation
1. Clone this repository
1. Copy `.env-sample` to `.env`
1. Run docker-compose up -d to run the containers
1. Create the database: docker-compose run phoenix mix ecto.create
1. Run the migrations: docker-compose run phoenix mix ecto.migrate
1. Seed the database: docker-compose run phoenix mix ecto.migrate
1. Visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see code sponsor running.

#### Without Docker (native setup)

Here are some basic stemps to get Code Sponsor running:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:codesponsor/web.git
cd web/
# Optionally set the following environment variables
# MAILGUN_API_KEY=SOMETHING
# MAILGUN_DOMAIN=SOMETHING
# config postgres in config/dev.exs
# start postgres
mix deps.get
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
mix code_sponsor.seed
cd assets && npm install
cd ../
mix phx.server
```

#### Install Nanobox

[Download and Install Nanobox](https://nanobox.io/download)

#### Clone the repo

    # clone the code
    git clone https://github.com/codesponsor/web.git

    # cd into the phoenix app
    cd web

#### Run the app

    # Add a convenient way to access your app from the browser
    nanobox dns add local codesponsor.local
    
    # Set up environment variables
    nanobox evar add local \
      MAILGUN_API_KEY=__MAILGUN_API_KEY__ \
      MAILGUN_DOMAIN=__MAILGUN_DOMAIN__ \
      SECRET_KEY_BASE=__SECRET_KEY_BASE__

    # Run phoenix
    nanobox run mix phx.server
    
#### Open in browser

Visit your app at [http://codesponsor.local:4000](http://codesponsor.local:4000)

#### Explore

With Nanobox, you have everything you need develop and run your phoenix app:

    # drop into a Nanobox console
    nanobox run

    # where elixir is installed,
    elixir -v

    # your packages are available,
    mix list

    # and your code is mounted
    ls

    # exit the console
    exit

## Road map

We have a road map of what we are going to implement next.

[Code Sponsor Q1 Goals](https://github.com/codesponsor/web/issues/1)

If you wish to add features that are not on the road map, you're very welcome to do so. We encourage you to
[create an Issue](https://github.com/codesponsor/web/issues/new)
before coding, so we can all discuss the relevance to the community.

Please keep in mind that the focus is to create a great platform, so we might not implement/accept all the suggested features.
